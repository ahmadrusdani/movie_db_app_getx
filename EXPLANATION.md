# 🧑‍🎨 UI Design Explanation

This app’s UI is intentionally designed to reflect familiarity and usability based on popular streaming and movie platforms:

## 🏠 Home Page

- Horizontal movie previews are inspired by platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.
- Each category (e.g. Now Playing, Popular) is displayed in a row slider for fast browsing.
- This layout allows quick scanning without overwhelming the user.

## 📄 Detail Page

- Shows essential movie information in a simple and clean format.
- Designed to mimic standard layouts seen in popular movie database apps like TMDb or IMDb.
- Prioritizes readability of title, genre, release date, and overview.

## 🔍 Search & List Page

- Uses larger poster previews and vertically stacked items for better visibility.
- Helps the user identify the right movie from detailed information and bigger artwork.
- Improves the scanning experience for longer lists compared to the compact home cards.

## ⭐ Favorite Page

- Uses a list view layout instead of grid, to provide variety from the other pages.
- Focuses on quick access and consistent info display without visual clutter.
- Makes it easier to swipe or scroll through saved items one by one.
